This package provides Kerberos backend for Python Social Auth. It can be used to
enable passwordless authentication inside a Django app or any other application
that supports Python Social Auth. This is a pure Python implementation which doesn't
depend on Apache ``mod_auth_kerb``.

Installation
------------

To install::

    pip install social-auth-kerberos

**WARNING:** you will need gcc, Python and kerberos devel packages to
build the ``gssapi`` dependency because it doesn't provide binary packages. Try
``dnf install gcc krb5-devel python3-devel`` (Red Hat/Fedora) or
``apt-get install gcc libkrb5-dev libpython3-dev`` (Debian/Ubuntu).


Configuration
-------------

`Configure Python Social Auth <https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/index.html>`_
and then make sure you have the following settings enabled::


    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        'social_auth_kerberos.backend.KerberosAuth',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    ]

    SOCIAL_AUTH_KRB5_KEYTAB = '/Kiwi/your-application.keytab'

**IMPORTANT:**

The principal name for your Kiwi TCMS web service must be
``HTTP/<fqdn.example.com>@REALM.EXAMPLE.COM`` where ``fqdn.example.com`` is
the domain name of the Kiwi TCMS server and ``REALM.EXAMPLE.COM`` is the
Kerberos realm that is used in your organization.

``/Kiwi/your-application.keytab`` is the keytab file for your
web app principal! If you install this inside a Docker container make sure
to ``chown 1001:root``!


Pipeline configuration
----------------------

Python Social Auth, and by extension this plugin, will create new user accounts
upon first access of the web interface. In Kiwi TCMS users need to either be
in the special group *Tester* or have sufficient permissions to add/edit/delete
objects.

You can automatically assign new accounts to the *Tester* group if
you append ``social_auth_kerberos.pipeline.initiate_defaults`` to the end
of the ``SOCIAL_AUTH_PIPELINE`` setting.

**WARNING:** this is not done for you automatically because some administrators
may want to employ different behaviour for newly registered accounts!
